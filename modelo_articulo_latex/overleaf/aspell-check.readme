You need to have the GNU Aspell <http://aspell.net/> spell checker
installed for this to work.

In Ubuntu, do:

  > sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-en aspell-fr

In Windows, download the Win32 version of Aspell <http://aspell.net/win32>,
the precompiled dictionaries you need, and make sure the bin directory
containing aspell.exe is in your system's path.
